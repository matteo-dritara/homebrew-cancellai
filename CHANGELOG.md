## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: repo-specific instructions for AI coding agents.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull
  request templates.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- `docs/CLI.md`: a command reference generated directly from the argparse
  definitions by the new `scripts/gen_docs.py`, checked for drift in CI.
- `pyproject.toml` dev-tooling config (`ruff`, `mypy` in strict mode) and a
  matching `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- `.editorconfig` and `.github/dependabot.yml` (GitHub Actions ecosystem).
- CI now also runs `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict`, and
  the docs-drift check, in addition to the existing test suite.

### Changed

- Modernized type hints to PEP 604 syntax (`X | None` instead of
  `Optional[X]`) and moved `Iterator`/`Sequence` imports to
  `collections.abc`.
- `active_processes()` now resolves `ps` to an absolute path via
  `shutil.which` instead of relying on `$PATH` resolution at call time.
- Replaced an internal `assert` in `delete_codex_via_cli` with an explicit
  `ValueError` guard (assertions can be optimized away with `python -O`;
  this is a real invariant, not a debug check).
- Simplified several `try`/`except ...: pass` blocks to
  `contextlib.suppress(...)`.
- `cancellai.py` is now tracked as executable in git (it has a shebang).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-27

Initial public release.

### Added

- Safe cleanup CLI for old Codex CLI and Claude Code session data:
  `status` (read-only, default), `clean` (with dry-run, confirmation
  prompt, age cutoff, and keep-latest safety rail), and `configure` (sets
  Claude Code's own `cleanupPeriodDays`).
- Conservative-by-default safety model: protected name lists for
  auth/config/plugins/skills/memory, symlink-safe deletion, config-root
  validation, running-process detection, and preference for the official
  `codex delete --force` backend over raw filesystem deletion.
- MIT license, README, and a Homebrew formula (`Formula/cancellai.rb`) so
  the tool installs via `brew tap matteo-dritara/cancellai && brew install
  cancellai`.
